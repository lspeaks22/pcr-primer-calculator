# pcr-primer-calculator
This python code accepts two primers (forwards and reverse) to simply calculate each of their length, GC content, and Melting Tempature (Tm). 
It checks if the primers are a good pair by comparing their Tm values to ensure they are within ±2°C of each other.

This PCR Calculator project reflects skills I developed through my molecular biology, forensic research at Towson University, where I co-authored a poster presentation titled "Development of a PCR Assay for Pathogens from the Middle East" under the mentorship of Dr. Kelly Elkins.

In that project, I designed and tested forward and reverse primers for various pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus thuringiensis, and many others using bioinformatics tools such as OligoAnalyzer 3.1. and NCBI BLAST.

# pcr-primer-calculator
This python code accepts two primers (forwards and reverse) to simply calculate each of their length, GC content, and Melting Tempature (Tm). 
It checks if the primers are a good pair by comparing their Tm values to ensure they are within ±2°C of each other.

This PCR Calculator project reflects skills I developed through my molecular biology research at Towson University, where I co-authored a poster titled "Development of a PCR Assay for Pathogens from the Middle East" under the mentorship of Dr. Kelly Elkins.

In that project, I designed and tested forward and reverse primers for Acinetobacter baumannii, using bioinformatics tools like OligoCalc and NCBI BLAST. I validated primer specificity, calculated melting temperatures (Tm), and ran gel electrophoresis and HRM (high-resolution melt) curve analysis to ensure assay sensitivity and accuracy.
